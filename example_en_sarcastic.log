[2025-07-09 18:03:07] Warning response[sarcastic]: How utterly FASCINATING that GCC noticed 'format specifies type 'char *' but the argument has type 'int' '

[2025-07-09 18:03:07] Warning response[sarcastic]: What a STUNNING discovery from GCC about 'format specifies type 'double' but the argument has type 'const char *' '
